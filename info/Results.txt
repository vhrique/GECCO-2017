Submission Evaluation

For the evaluation of the submitted online-methods, the methods have been executed on a dataset unknown to the participants. The quality of the detector is then calculated using the F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is defined as:

F1 = 2 · (PPV · TPR) / (PPV + TPR)
with

PPV = ∑ TruePositive / ∑ PredictionPositive
and

TPR = ∑ TruePositive / ∑ConditionPositive ,
so that PPV describes the ration between the number of true positive predictions and the number of all positive predictions while TPR the ratio between the number of true positive predictions and the number of actual events. Per definition this score ranges from values from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best achievable score.
